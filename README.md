This is a simple next.js application with a graphcms backend used as my place for documenting my journey regarding web development, reading and writing, and breaking down games I find influential to talk about.

> **Tailwind:** This is also my first project using TailwindCSS and am never going back.


## Features

App consists of couple pages including /about, /photos, and /posts.
