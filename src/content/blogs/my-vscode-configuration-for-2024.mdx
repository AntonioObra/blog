After a year of looking at the default GitHub VSCode theme I had enough and decided to finally customize it to my liking. I was tired of looking at the same ugly font and colors and started exploring for some VSCode setups.

Whilst exploring i stumbled upon a blog post by [nexxel.dev](https://www.nexxel.dev/blog/neovim-to-vscode) where he talked about why he switched from Neovim back to VSCode and there I saw a screenshot of his configuration and wanted the same for myself. Thankfully he provided his whole configuration for VSCode and Neovim on his [GitHub](https://github.com/nexxeln/dots/tree/main/Library/Application%20Support/Code%20-%20Insiders/User). I've been using his configuration for about 2 months, and decided to customize it a bit more to my liking.

### Main changes I made to my configuration

The biggest thing that makes my configuration pop is font size and line height. I bumped them up quite a bit to get to my preferred sizes. With that VSCode already looks much better and with the addition of [Dank Mono](https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono) font it makes it complete. For the theme I use [Tokyo Storm Gogh](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Avetis.tokyo-night).

You can find my full configuration on my [GitHub](https://github.com/AntonioObra/dev-setup/blob/main/vscode/settings.json) and for all developers I recommend having a repository like this to have your configuration in one place if you ever need it, or can't login to your vscode on your job like me.

### Zen Mode

Possibly the best thing about VSCode for me is the zen mode. It allows me to have my file in the middle without any clutter, just my file, line numbers and that's it, if I need anything else I just shortcut my way to it. To enable zen mode you can either go to <code>View > Appearance > Zen Mode</code> or use the shortcut <code>Ctrl + K Z</code>.

### What about Neovim?

I've been watching a lot of [devaslife](https://www.youtube.com/@devaslife) lately and seeing him code using Neovim has certainly made me want to try it, but I really like my VSCode configuration and feel very comfortable using it, although I do plan to try it in some distant future and possibly stick to it and replace VSCode for good.

### Conclusion

I recommend to everybody to not just change your VSCode theme, but to edit and customize more, to find something to your liking and something you like to look at, because if you are like me you are looking at that VSCode editor for 8 hours every single day, so make it pretty.
