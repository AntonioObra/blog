Code Repo is a project I started to work on back in May 2023. It is a project that I have been working on for a while now and I am very excited about it. After the initial release, and seeing how people were using it, or should I say how I am using it, I now know what I need to do to make it better. 

The actual only feature that is currently working and I am using actively is the [resources page](https://coderepo.obradovic.dev/resources/) containing a lot of diffrent links to resources that I use on a daily basis and believe that they are worth sharing. 

With the preparation of building the new version of Code Repo, I have a lot of new ideas that I want to implement and actually make it a useful tool for me and hopefully for others as well.

### All of the new features that I am planning to implement are listed below:
- [x] Add resources page
- [ ] Add more resources
- [ ] Add more code snippets
- [ ] Add more examples
- [ ] Add online code editor
- [ ] User authentication, user profiles, and user dashboard
- [ ] Monthly newsletter
- [ ] Subscription service, paid content, and premium features

To be honest, I am not sure how long it will take me to implement all of these features, but I am hoping that I will be able to do it in the next couple of months. With each new feature, I will write a blog post about it and explain how I implemented it and what I learned from it. 

I am very excited about this project and I hope that you will be too. If you have any suggestions or ideas on how to improve Code Repo, contact me through the [contact page](https://blog.obradovic.dev/contact/).
