After a lot of pain and suffering, Code Repo is finally live. With countless refactors, redesigns, and rewrites, the project is now in a state where I can say that it is ready for the public.

### What is new?

A lot has happened since the last blog post. The project has been abandoned and picked up again multiple times over the course of the last year or so. The design has been changed multiple times, the tech stack has been changed multiple times, and the features have been changed multiple times.

The project started as a simple resource page with links to resources that I use on a daily basis. It then evolved into a full-blown code repository with user authentication, user profiles, and a user dashboard with the ability to save resources and guides for future reference. And with new additions like templates, handbooks, and a playground feature coming soon, I have high hopes for the project.

### Final tech stack

The original [Code Repo](https://coderepo.obradovic.dev/) that was built in May 2023 was basically just an idea I had to have all my web development resources in one place, instead of having them lay around in dozens of notion pages, various bookmarks, and a bunch of other places. It was based on a [taxonomy project](https://tx.shadcn.com/) built by [shadcn](https://shadcn.com/), which I then forked and modified to fit my needs, or should I say, copied and pasted. To this day, some of the same design choices are still present in the project. The project was built with following tech stack:

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- ShadcnUI
- Vercel

And that's pretty much it, it was a pretty simple static site with no backend, no database, no nothing. Just a bunch of markdown files that were rendered as static pages.

#### So, what has changed since then?

Well, a lot. The project has been rewritten from scratch multiple times, jumping from one tech stack to another, from one design to another, from one feature to another. From my original idea of building it with Astro and Golang with Supabase, to discovering that Astro didn't meet my dynamic application needs, I switched to NextJS with Golang. After a few weeks of writing Golang backend code and watching an interesting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suZJNHoT7JI) that changed my perspective on writing full stack JS/TS applications, I dropped Golang and adopted the T3 stack.

T3 stack was by far the best solution for my needs and was easy to work with, although not perfect, but as close as it gets. Coupled with Prisma for my ORM, Supabase for my backend, TRPC for my APIs, working with it was amazing, and I definitely gained some perspective about writing my code more efficiently and better.

### A lot more to go

Here are some exciting new features that will be added to Code Repo in the near future:

1. Templates: Users will be able to create and share code templates for different programming languages and frameworks. This will make it easier for developers to start new projects or learn new technologies.

2. Handbooks: Code Repo will have comprehensive handbooks on various topics, providing in-depth guides and tutorials for developers. These handbooks will cover a wide range of subjects, from beginner to advanced topics.

3. Playground: A built-in code playground will be added to Code Repo, allowing users to write and test their code directly in the browser. This will be a great tool for experimenting with different code snippets and learning new concepts.

These new features will further enhance the functionality and usefulness of Code Repo, making it a valuable resource for developers of all levels. Stay tuned for updates and announcements as we continue to improve and expand the platform!

I am very excited about this project, and I hope that you are too. If you have any suggestions or ideas on how to improve Code Repo, contact me through the [contact page](https://blog.obradovic.dev/contact/).
